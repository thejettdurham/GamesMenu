- Force Landscape Orientation
- Redux for state management (copy app structure from peckish app)
- React Navigation for Items - ModGrp - ModItems  sub screen
    - Initial try before fully implementing state: Got it to render as a sub-component, but it seems at cursory glance that it's only possible to have a stylizable navigator by implementing a fully customized one. For this reason, I think react-navigation is overkill for my use-case, and I think the relatively simple functionality required for this app can be handled with redux directly.
- App State:
    - SelectionContainer
        - ConfirmedSelections? (array of selections, shape of which defined below)
        - ActiveSelection?
            - groupId: number
            - itemId: number
            - modifiers: array<number>
    - GroupContainer
        - SelectedGroup?
    - ItemContainer
        - ActiveScreenId?
    - NavContainer
        - ButtonIsEnabled
            - undo: bool
            - accept: bool
